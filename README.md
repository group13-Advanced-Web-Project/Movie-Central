## How It Works



The **Movie-Central** operates using a client-server architecture:

1. **Frontend**: Built with **React**, it handles all user interactions like browsing movies, viewing reviews, and managing user accounts. It communicates with the backend via API calls.
2. **Backend**: Powered by **Node.js** and **Express**, the backend processes requests from the frontend, handling movie data, user authentication, and more.
3. **Database**: **PostgreSQL** stores all movie data, user profiles, and reviews, ensuring data is stored persistently and can be queried efficiently.
4. **Authentication**: Users sign up and log in to access personalized features such as favorites, reviews, and movie groups. Authentication is managed securely through **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.

This architecture ensures a seamless and interactive experience for users, from discovering movies to interacting with friends and sharing opinions.

## Installation and Setup

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   `git clone https://github.com/group13-Advanced-Web-Project/movie-app.git`

2. **Install dependencies**:  
   Navigate to the frontend and backend directories and install the required packages:
   - Frontend:  
     `cd frontend && npm install`
   - Backend:  
     `cd backend && npm install`

3. **Set up environment variables**:  
   Create a `.env` file in both the frontend and backend folders and add the required environment variables.

4. **Set up PostgreSQL**:  
   - Create a local or cloud PostgreSQL database.
   - Run the database schema script to set up tables and relationships.
     > **Add schema script here**.

5. **Start the application**:
   - Run the backend server:  
     `cd backend && npm start`
   - Run the frontend server:  
     `cd frontend && npm start`

The app should now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.
